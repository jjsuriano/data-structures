Definitions:
* Data is information that is stored or processed by a computer. 
* Data Type is an attribute of data that describes the values it can have and how the data can be used.
* Data Structures are containers that allow us to combine several pieces of data into a single structure. They help us connect and group our data and give us organization, storage and access the data in an efficient manner.

Data Types - primitive, basic, value: 
* Numbers:
    - Whole numbers
        short (16 bits; from -32,768 to 32,767)
        int (32 bits; from ~-2 billion to ~2 billion)
        long (64 bits; from -(2^63) to 2^63)
    - Decimal numbers: 
        float (32 bits; ~7 decimal digits)
        double (64 bits: ~16 decimal digits)
    - Signed 
        contains positive and negative values
        16-bit short range: -32,768 to 32,767
    - Unsigned
        containes only positive values and it doubles the range
        16-bit short range: 0 to 65,535

* Boolean 
    - bool
        True (1 bit; 1)
        False (1 bit; 0)

* Characters 
    - char
        A single character

Data Structures

Size of a data structure depends on how much the programmer allocates, unlike the defined storage of the primitive types. 

* String
    - A sequence of characters that is surrounded by matching single, double or tripple quotation marks.
